										<h1>Critical Reasoning</h1>

							<blockquote>Does the structure of a flipped classroom allow students to have a better understanding
							on the applicability of mathematics and the way it influences their learning and reasoning?
							In the flipped classroom setting, students are able to investigate and discover the importance
							of the process rather than the facts behind the math.</blockquote><br><br>
							<p> A year ago, my research professor, Dr. McFaddin, and I posed this question. Since then, we have collectively
							gathered a variety of resources to aid us in answering our question. We had hoped to perform a research experiment
							in which we would collaborate with a local middle school and implement a flipped learning environment. Our take on
							"flipping" the classroom is to create lecture videos to watch at home and conduct the "homework" in class. This allows
							more student-to-teacher interactions, leading to more success on understanding the homework rather than leaving the homework 
							untouched due to confusion. Though we were not able to conduct this observation for this grant, we agreed to utilize the resources
							we had obtained over the previous semester and offer them to the public.
							We have begun gathering resources for educators and contacted middle school teachers to gauge interest in
							 flipped learning and willingness to implement in their own classrooms. Our long-term goal is to obtain specifics of
							 what resources teachers would want and ultimately try out lectures in middle schools.
							 </p>
							<br>
							<p>I have provided linkes in the menu under "Flipped Resources" that I highly recommend checking out. Some attest to the success of a flipped classroom,
							such as the entirely flipped high school, Clintondale High School. I also have information on ways to test critical reasoning skills and more engaging
							class activities for the students.</p>

							inside the classroom now take place outside the classroom and vice versa.”<sup>1</sup></h2>
							<br><p><h3>Entirely Flipped High School <i>(linked in YouTube Resources) </i><sup>2</sup></h3></p><br>
							<p><h4>Benefits from Flipping</h4></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Decreased number of students failing</li>
								<li>One-on-one interactions between teachers and students</li>
								<li>Can watch the videos from computer, phone, tablet, etc</li>
								<li>If a student doesn't have internet access at home, he can obtain a flash drive or DVD for the lecture</li>
							</ul>
							<br><p><h3>Byron School District<sup>3</sup></h3></p>
							<p><i>In 2006, Byron’s high school math mastery level was 29.9% on the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (MCA). 
							In 2010, its mastery rate had risen to 65.6% as a result of data analysis and curriculum alignment with state standards.</i></p>
							<h4>Highlights of Byron</h4>
								<ul>
								<li>Able to do away with textbooks all together</li>
								<li>Great response for mathematics teachers</li>
								<li>Teachers able to create their own math curriculum and have flexibility with videos</li>
								<li>Good for schools with low income</li>
								<li>Don't have to budget for new textbooks</li>
								</ul>
							<p><blockquote>It takes a lot of work and time to get the flipped classroom where it should be, but it’s worth it because it is “for the kids.” - Jen Green</blockquote></p>
							<br>
							<p>By having video lectures, students have the flexibility to watch them whenever and wherever. The videos tend to be short, so even if 
							students do not watch the lectures at home, they can watch them in class and not fall too far behind.
							Students that are ahead of their peers on homework can tutor one another or work on other schoolwork.
							Flipped classroom allows you to “differentiate your students.” Students are able to work at their own pace whether tha means 
							working ahead of others or requiring extra assistance from the teachers.</p></section>
